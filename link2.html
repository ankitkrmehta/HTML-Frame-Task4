    <h2><b>First Stage:Dryopithecus</b></h2>
    <p class="ad">These are deemed to be the ancestors of both man and apes. They lived in China, Africa, Europe and India. The genus Dryopithecus refers to the oak wood apes. When Dryopithecus was alive, the tropical lowlands which it inhabited were densely forested, so the members could have predominantly been herbivores.</p>
    <h2><b>Second Stage:Ramapithecus</b></h2>
    <p class="sd">This is an extinct anthropoid ape of the Miocene epoch, known from remains found in south-western Asia and East Africa, and probably ancestral to the orangutan. Their first remains were discovered from the Shivalik range in Punjab and later in Africa and Saudi Arabia. They lived in open grasslands. </p>
    <h2><b>Third stage:Australopithecus</b></h2>
    <p class="ad sd">The fossil of this genus was first discovered in 1924 in South Africa. They lived on the ground, used stones as weapons and walked erect. They were 4 feet tall and weighed 60-80 pounds.</p>
